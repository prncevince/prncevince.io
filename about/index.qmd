üëã I'm Vince. In 2017, I received my Bachelor of Science in mathematics & a minor in statistics from <a href="https://www.psu.edu" style="color: #1e407c">Penn State</a>. Afterward, I spent 5+ years at what is now [Peraton](https://www.peraton.com) working a few Geospatial Intelligence data science missions on the [NGA's](https://www.nga.mil) enterprise systems engineering contract. Recently, I was an AI Engineer at Booz Allen where I conducted statistical performance analyses against Earth observing satellite imagery object detection algorithms. 

Currently, I'm job seeking in Southern California after having recently traveled 8,000+ miles by car across <a class="usa" href="usapop.html" target="_blank"></a> to the West coast. I'm always searching for my next [big]{style='font-size:1.1em'} (or [tiny]{style='font-size:0.75em'}) data science adventure.

I enjoy spatial analytics. I hope that I can help shed some light on spatial topics to those who are also interested with this site. It's built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

When I'm not head down in geeky stuff, I enjoy salsa dancing, sports (go birds ü¶Ö), and jumping out of aircraft (did it once - was fun & a bit terrifying).

If you're interesting in learning more about my career, here's a web version of my [r√©sum√©](/resume){.external target='_blank'}.

Thanks for stopping by. ‚úåÔ∏è
